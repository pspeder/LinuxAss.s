#Shell Pimpin'
So, now that you're somewhat more confident in a terminal, let's shake up
the shell a little.

##How and when the shell loads what files
So you may have noticed those files in your home drive, all relating to
`bash` somehow. Those determine, what your terminal looks and feels like
(what language applications should choose, preferred editor or browser,
what information the "prompt" should show), also what programmes you are
able to run and where programmes should look to find certain files they
might need.

The files are loaded in a specific order, which is explained at
