= CLI-tools
CLI stands for Command Line Interface, thus, this folder describes some
common applications that run inside a terminal (or terminal emulator).
Most (if not all) of the applications described in this folder are available on
all modern linux distros (Ubuntu and Archlinux included), and will often be
installed as part of the base system. Use your package manager to install them
if the commands do not exist.
