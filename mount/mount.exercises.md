1. What does the `mount -B <fs> <mount point>` command do?
2. Read `man fstab` to understand the file `/etc/fstab`
    Which mount options (fs_mntops) would a file system be mounted with if mounted through the command:

      mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/mountpoint1

  * HINT: which are the default mount options?

3. Take a look at your own `/etc/fstab`-file`

    cat /etc/fstab

   ...so that you understand how your filesystem is mounted.
