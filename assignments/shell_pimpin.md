#Shell Pimpin'
So, now that you're somewhat more confident in a terminal, let's shake up
the shell a little.

Please note that this is pretty much a `bash`-oriented guide, also this is
an area in which zsh sets itself apart - zsh is somewhat more customizable
one might say: I realise it might not be a totally fair comparison, but `man bash`
is ~7250 lines, against `man zshall`'s ~33500, and I don't think that that
picture is totally skewed. Hence, if reading and solving this, leaves you
hungry for more shell customisations, I recommend zsh.

##Frameworks
There are various repositories out there, containing various scripts for
use in customisation of your shell. These are beyond the focus of this article,
and can also make your shell fell a little sluggish (which it shouldn't).

However, often times a lot of good community effort has been put into these
frameworks, and it can be worth your while to look through sources of such
frameworks to copy specific functions or the likes to your own config.

##How and when the shell loads what files
So you may have noticed those files in your home dir, all relating to
`bash` somehow. Those determine, what your terminal looks and feels like
(what language applications should choose, preferred editor or browser,
what information the "prompt" should show), and also things as what
programmes you are able to run and where programmes should look to find
certain files they might need (in other words: your `environment variables`).

The files are loaded in a specific order, which I think is explained well on
* GNU's own webpage (bash is developed by GNU):

  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html)
* This wordpress blog I found, with detailed charts over a terminals startup
  process:

  https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/)

N.B. If you did not read the above: beware, not all files are loaded for all
shell environments you will meet.

##Da Pimpin'
1. Make a shell that looks like this:
  ```
  ehlm@hamstarch l:118 > â–ˆ
  ```
  ...where:
  * ehlm is coloured with your terminals green colour
  * hamstarch is coloured with a colour of your own choosing
  * `l` stands for line and corresponds to which line in your terminal
    that you are currently about to enter.

2. Take a piece of paper and describe (with words and/or illustration) how
  you would like your prompt to look.

  Specifically, you should consider some of the following:
  * which information do you want displayed,
  * should it be a minimalistic terminal or would you prefer to have, for
    instance, version control information displayed when you're in a repos,
  * maybe you want a 2-liner prompt, with room for displaying all sorts of
    things, including: mail count, battery level, network signal, date/time,

3. Take a look at the available options in bash, and try changing some with
  a command like:
  ```
  set -o dotglob # allow files beginning with '.' to be returned in the
                 # results of path-name expansion (autocompletion e.g.)
  ```
  ...remember that these setting will only apply to shell that you have typed
  the command, to make it permanent, add it to your `~/.bashrc`-file.

5. Search the web for others' configs. Quite a lot of useful hacks out there.

6. Implement the prompt you designed in step 2.
