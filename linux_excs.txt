* Show all files that were opened by your user - even those that you did not
  explicitly start yourself. You might want to write the output of the above
  to a file for the next assignment.

* Count the number of lines in the output of the command above.

* Sort the file alphanumerically (as in the following order:
  ABC1 ABc1 Abc1 abc1 1ABC 1ABc 1Abc 1abc)

* Write a script, which, upon invocation, will create a folder (a), and
  in that folder create 10 files (b0-9) (with a single line input).
  The folder creation must be done with the following command (at a
  location you decide):

    mkdir -pv <folder-name>

    `-p` for parents (will not fail on non-existing parent folders)
    `-v` for verbose (spit out more output - to make the exercise harder)

* Adapt your script from the previous exercise to silence all output.

* Adapt your script so that the user can input what text is put in the
  files.

* Allow different input for the 10 different files

* Combining the exercises above, let your script
  1. Take as input an integer, defining how many files should be created
     and verify that the input is indeed an integer.
     Hint: You might wanna store that number in a variable
  2. Take as input a string, to let the user chose where to store the folder
     with the files in it, and ensure that the given string is path
  3. 


* Write a script that suppresses the output a given command.
