* Show all files that were opened by your user - even those that you did not
  explicitly start yourself. You might want to write the output of the above
  to a file for the next assignment.

* Count the number of lines in the output of the command above.

* Sort the file alphanumerically (as in the following order:
  ABC1 ABc1 Abc1 abc1 1ABC 1ABc 1Abc 1abc)

* Write a script, which, upon invocation, will create a folder (a), and
  in that folder create 10 files (b0-9) (with a single line input).
  The folder creation must be done with the following command (at a
  location you decide):

    mkdir -pv <folder-name/a>



******************
Hints:
 1. mkdir
 2. 



* Write a script that suppresses the output a given command.
